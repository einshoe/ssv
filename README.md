-------------------------------------
(Docs below are legacy from the original webpack Biolerplate example from Tania Rascia at https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate)

## Usage

### Development server

```bash
npm start
```

You can view the development server at `localhost:8080`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

> Note: Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally to deploy a simple server.

```bash
npm i -g http-server
```

You can view the deploy by creating a server in `dist`.

```bash
cd dist && http-server
```

1. To publish use this command:
    npm publish --access public
2. If you want to delete your package from npm, then use this command:
    npm unpublish [package_name]
3. npm version major|minor|patch
4. You can test your package locally using this command:
    npm link

## Note on versioning

1. Major releases contain significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.

2. Minor releases contain new smaller features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release. We update peer dependencies in minor versions by expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies.

3. Patch releases are low risk, bug fix releases. No developer assistance is expected during update.
